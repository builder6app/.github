## 🚀 Our Mission

**Builder6** is redefining how enterprise software is built. We believe in the power of **Generative AI** to accelerate development, without compromising data privacy or vendor independence.

We provide a cloud-based "AI Factory" where you can design applications using natural language prompts. Once built, you receive the full source code/metadata package to run **on your own infrastructure**.

## 💡 Core Philosophy

* **🤖 AI-First Engineering:** Don't just drag and drop. Talk to the AI to generate data models, UIs, and business logic.
* **☁️ Cloud IDE:** Zero setup. Start developing in your browser instantly.
* **🔒 Data Sovereignty:** Your production data belongs to you. Export your app and deploy it on-premise, in a private cloud, or on the edge.

## 🛠️ Key Projects

* **[builder6.com](https://github.com/builder6app/builder6.com)**: The core repository for our AI-native cloud editor. Built with Next.js, Amis, and NestJS.
