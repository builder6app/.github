## 🧬 Our DNA: AI + Low-Code

We believe the future of coding is conversational. **Build6** provides the ecosystem to make this happen:

1.  **AI-First Design**: Don't start with a blank canvas. Start with a prompt.
2.  **Cloud-Native DX**: No environment setup. Design data models and UIs instantly in the cloud.
3.  **Local Execution**: We value your data privacy. Export your AI-generated apps and run them on your own private infrastructure.
